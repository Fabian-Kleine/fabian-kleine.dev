## Exporting a Template

By hitting the download button you can export your mockup as a png file.

The app will then generate a png file with the current state of the editor using the [DOM to Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-to-image/v/2.2.1) package and download it to your computer.

# User Interface

The apps user interface was made with [PrimeVue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
The components provided by PrimeVue made it easy to create a nice looking user interface.
