# Setup

The portfolio page is build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
The page supports light and dark mode using the [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) package.
The content e.g. this projects page is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format, which allows for easy content creation and management.

## Pages

As of now the portfolio has three pages:
- **Home**: The home page is the first page you see when you visit the portfolio. It contains some information about my techstack and projects and is the most eye-catching page.
- **Projects**: The projects page contains a list of all my projects.
- **Project Detail**: The project detail page contains a detailed description of the project, the techstack used and a link to the demo and the source code.

## Project Detail Page

The project detail page are generated using a dynmaic route in Next.js (`/projects/[slug]`).
The slug is the name of the project and is used to fetch the mdx file from the `projects` folder.

The project detail page is build using the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format, which allows for easy content creation and management.
MDX is setup to use the plugins [rehype-highlight](https://npmjs.com/package/rehype-highlight) and [rehype-github-alerts](https://npmjs.com/package/rehype-github-alerts) to highlight code and show alerts like in Github README files.
This is an exmple of a code block showing the `next.config.ts` file of this project:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [new URL("https://cdn.simpleicons.org/**")],
  },
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight, rehypeGithubAlerts],
  },
});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

These are the possible alerts you can use in the mdx files:

> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]  
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

Further MDX is setup to use the Shadcns Typography components [@shadcn/typography](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/typography) to style the text and headings.
In `mdx-components.tsx` the components are imported and used to render the content of the mdx file:

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'
import { 
    TypographyBlockquote, 
    TypographyH1, 
    TypographyH2, 
    TypographyH3, 
    TypographyH4, 
    TypographyInlineCode, 
    TypographyLink, 
    TypographyList, 
    TypographyP
} from '@/components/blog/typography';
import { cn } from './lib/utils'

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        h1: (props) => <TypographyH1 {...props} />,
        h2: (props) => <TypographyH2 {...props} />,
        h3: (props) => <TypographyH3 {...props} />,
        h4: (props) => <TypographyH4 {...props} />,
        p: (props) => <TypographyP {...props} />,
        ul: (props) => <TypographyList {...props} />,
        a: ({ children, ...props }) => <TypographyLink {...props}>{children}</TypographyLink>,
        pre: (props) => <pre {...props} className="relative -z-10 -top-8" />,
        code: (props) => <TypographyInlineCode {...props} className={cn(props.className)} />,
        blockquote: (props) => <TypographyBlockquote {...props} />,
        ...components
    }
}
```

Every Project exports a metadata object which is used to render a preview of the project on the projects page.

```javascript
export const metadata = {
    title: 'Some Project',
    description: 'Some Project Description',
    img: "/projects/project.png", // preview image of the project
    video: "/projects/project.mp4", // preview video of the project
    // list of features on the projects page and the Quick Overview Section
    bullets: [
        "Feature 1",
        "Feature 2",
        "Feature 3",
        "Feature 4",
    ],
    // Tech Stack used in the project
    techs: [
        { name: "Next.js", icon: "next.js" }, 
        { name: "Shadcn UI", icon: "shadcnui" }, 
        { name: "Tailwind CSS", icon: "tailwindcss" }
    ],
    demo: "https://example.com", // link to the demo of the project
    github: "https://github.com/Fabian-Kleine/example", // link to the github repo of the project
    slug: "project", // slug of the project used in the dynamic route
}
```

## Contact Form

The contact form is a dialog which sends an emial to me and a confirmation email to the user using [nodemailer](https://www.nodemailer.com/).
It uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the input and [Zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) to preserve the forms state accross multiple dialogs.

# User Interface

The user interface is build using [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Further it uses components from [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) to make the UI more appealing.
The UI is responsive and works on all devices. The UI is also dark mode compatible and uses the [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) package to switch between light and dark mode.

The UI sticks to the simplicity of Shadcn UI but adds some fancy and fresh components using Magic UI to make especially the home page more appealing.
Further some blur in and text typing animations are used from Magic UI in the home pages hero section to make a good first impression.

# Learnings
- Correct usage of MDX with Next.js
- Next.js 15
- Dynamic Routes

# Comparison to the old Portfolio
The [old portfolio](/projects/portfolio-legacy) was build using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) which made it way more complicated than using Next.js.
It used JSON files to store the projects which was a lot harder to edit and maintain compared to MDX which I use now.

The User Interface is a question of preference. I like the new one more because it is more modern and cleaner. The old UI used lots of colors but in the new one I stuck to a more simple and clean design. 

The old portfolios cotact form just used a generated `mailto:` link which was not very user friendly. The new one uses a dialog and sends an email to me and a confirmation email to the user using [nodemailer](https://www.nodemailer.com/).
