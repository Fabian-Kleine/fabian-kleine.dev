# Process

## Retrival of Geolocation

When a City or Postal Code is entered, the app uses the [Nominatim Geolocation API](https://nominatim.org/) to get the coordinates of the location. The coordinates are then used to get the weather data from the [Meteomatics Weather API](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/weather-api/).

Alternatively, the app uses the [Browser Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the current location of the user. The coordinates are then used to get the weather data from the [Meteomatics Weather API](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/weather-api/).
When the Geolocation is fetched from the Browser the app uses the [Nominatim Geolocation API](https://nominatim.org/) Reverse Strategy to get the display name of the location.

## Fetching of Weather Data

After the app recieved the data from the [Meteomatics Weather API](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/weather-api/) it transforms it to make it more usable.
The data is then stored in the app state and displayed in the app. The app uses the [Vue Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) to manage the state and the data fetching.

## Display of Weather Data
The data is then displayed in the app. The app uses the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library with *vue-chart-3* to display the temperature and precipitation in a graph. The app also uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to style the app.

# User Interface

## General Design

The apps user interface was inspired by **Samsung Weather** and the designs presented in this [Blog Post](https://www.subframe.com/tips/weather-website-design-examples). 

Many elements have a glass morphism effect which fits the weather theme. This is achieved by using a **CSS Blur** effect.

```css
.glass {
  background: linear-gradient(to top right, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25));
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.milky-glass {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
  backdrop-filter: blur(15px);
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2), 
              inset 0 2px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
}
```

Further [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) was used as icon library. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used with [Bootstrap Vue Next](https://bootstrap-vue-next.github.io/bootstrap-vue-next/) to style the app more easily.

The app is fully responsive and works on all devices. The app also uses the [Bootstrap Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/borders/) to style the app.

## Background

The app uses a dynamic background which gets lighter or darker depending on the weather. 

This effect is achieved by using a **CSS Gradient** as background and then moving it up and down depending on the weather.

```css
.app-container {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, 
    #295988, 
    #2d6da1, 
    #4a9dff, 
    #5aa4ff,
    #6aabff, 
    #7bb3ff,
    #8bbcff);
  background-size: 400% 400%;
  transition: background 3s;
}
```

Moving the gradient up and down is achieved by using the `background-position` property. The background position is mapped onto the weather type. 

```jsx 
<div class="app-container" :style="{ backgroundPosition: weatherData ? weatherData[dayIndex].weatherIcon.backgroundPosition : 'center' }">
```

## Weather Icons

The App uses the Weather Icons from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) and some custom made SVG icons. 
The icons are mapped onto the weather types provided by meteomatics. This includes:

- **Weather Description**: The description provided by meteomatics is used to determine the weather type.
- **Icon**: The icon is mapped to the weather type. The icons are provided by [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) and some custom made SVG icons.
- **Icon Color**
- **Background Position**: The background position is used to move the gradient up and down depending on the weather.

```javascript
const getWeatherIcon = (weatherType) => {
    const weatherIcons = {
        '1': { // Sunny
            icon: 'bi-sun-fill',
            iconColor: '#FFD700',
            weatherDescription: 'Sunny',
            backgroundPosition: 'bottom',
        },
        '2': { // Light clouds
            icon: './icons/cloud-sun-fill.svg',
            isSVGIcon: true,
            weatherDescription: 'Light clouds',
            backgroundPosition: 'bottom',
        },

        // ...more weather types

        '5': { // Rainy
            icon: 'bi-cloud-rain-fill',
            iconColor: '#FFF',
            weatherDescription: 'Rainy',
            backgroundPosition: 'top',
        },

        // ...more weather types
    };

    return weatherIcons[weatherType] || weatherIcons['4'];
}
```


# Difficulties

## Timezones
A major dificulty were the **timezones** for the sunrise and sunset.
By Default the Browser uses the local timezone of the user but that didnt make sense for the app.

The solution was the [tz-lookup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tz-lookup) library which uses the coordinates of the location to get the timezone of the location.

## Two Colored Icons

We needed Icons like a sun behind a cloud which we wanted to be yellow and white but [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) does not support two colored icons. 

The solution was to recreate some icons as SVGs with two colors and use them in the app.
